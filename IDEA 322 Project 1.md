## Project Proposals
**1.** While looking through *The 100 Show The Thirteenth Annual of the American Center for Design*, I found a lot of artwork that I heavily enjoyed. Despite not necessarily relating, these works felt as though they could be collaged to be recontextualized in order to challenge the confines of the body, especially in relation to gender dysphoria and gender presentation.  
  
**2.** This sort of relates to the previous project, but taking some of the medical artwork from Paul Peck to create a more gruesome portrayal of the human body as commentary on how the body functions, and making the viewer more aware of their own body and how it functions.  
  
**3.** For this proposal, maybe taking some of the inventions from the World's Fair and comparing these objects to how they've either helped or hurt the environment after having been debuted at this event. Also, visually comparing the changes that have occurred for these objects in the last 90 years.
