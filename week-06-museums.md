## Cripping the Map  
I am currently working on a project with the Disability Cultural Center called "Cripping the Map." We are creating a digital archive of grassroots events relating to disability culture as well as a contemporary people's history. We are in the process of collecting stories 
from as many people as we can around Chicago so that we can create our own map of modern-day Chicago and plot points that correlate to these stories, histories, businesses, projects, etc. that have occurred or are still present in Chicago.  
  
We don't have a specific mission statement, but an excerpt from our project information blurb stating, "The map seeks to honor disability histories and disability culture throughout the city... This People’s History endeavors to make space for stories written by and for 
multiply marginalized disabled people (working class/poor disabled communities; people whose experiences of disability intersect with raced and gendered histories of eugenics, colonization, imperialist wars, and slavery)."  
  
Our goal with this project is to archive events that have been poorly archived in the past or personal histories that would be lost as time passes. Another goal is to demonstrate the common phrase used in disability cultural spaces, "Nothing about us without us" esentially
creating a space where individuals of all types with disabilities are included in conversations regarding histories and current events.
